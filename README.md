This is a project for the class CSE482 Big Data Analysis. The goal is to build a movie recommender system with web interface.


Organization: 
 - For working together please write down what tasks that need doing. If you want to do them write your name behind them in brackets. When you completed the tast write 'done' behind them. If you have interesting ideas what else to try also make a note here so we know what has been tried already. 

 Notes:
- If you need an additional package install it in the environment with pip and then generate a new requirements file using 'pip freeze > requirements.txt'. This will help others run your newly added code.
